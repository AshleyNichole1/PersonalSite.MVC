                                    I am a Full Stack Web Developer and I am passionate about people! I love being on a team and am inspired by the work and stories of others. I am always on the lookout to grow my skills. When I'm not coding I enjoy being outside, book club with my friends, and adventuring with my family!

                                    I’m a former Director of Operations turned Web Developer. I’ve always had a desire to take on new challenges and be better than I was the day before. Web development suits me well, because it gives me the ability to take on different challenges and use the creative, and complex, problem-solving techniques I’ve obtained through my previous work experience, and apply them to come up with solutions.
